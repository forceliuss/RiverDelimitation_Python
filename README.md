## Introduction / Introducción

> The process of retrieving information from satellite imagery could be time consuming and faces challenges like image resolution, feature recognition and user criteria. With the use of band combination together with geospatial tools in Python we can delineate water bodies as rivers from panchromatic /multiband images with results as geospatial shapefiles. This webinar will cover the delimitation of water bodies as rivers from a panchromatic Landsat 8 image. The webinar shows a mixed procedure that creates a high contrast image for rivers with Python and Rasterio , then polygonizes the image array and exports the river edges as a georeferenced Shapefile.

## Intructor / Instructor:

### _Saul Montoya M.Sc_

#### Hydrogeologist - Numerical Modeler

> Mr. Montoya is a Civil Engineer graduated from the Catholic University in Lima with postgraduate studies in Management and Engineering of Water Resources (WAREM Program) from Stuttgart University – Germany with mention in Groundwater Engineering and Hydroinformatics. Mr Montoya has a strong analytical capacity for the interpretation, conceptualization and modeling of the surface and underground water cycle and their interaction. He is in charge of numerical modeling for contaminant transport and remediation systems of contaminated sites. Inside his hydrological and hydrogeological investigations Mr. Montoya has developed an holistic comprehension of the water cycle, understanding and quantifying the main hydrological dynamic process of precipitation, runoff, evaporation and recharge to the groundwater system.
