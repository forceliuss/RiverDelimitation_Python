## Introduction / IntroducciÃ³n

> The process of retrieving information from satellite imagery could be time consuming and faces challenges like image resolution, feature recognition and user criteria. With the use of band combination together with geospatial tools in Python we can delineate water bodies as rivers from panchromatic /multiband images with results as geospatial shapefiles. This webinar will cover the delimitation of water bodies as rivers from a panchromatic Landsat 8 image. The webinar shows a mixed procedure that creates a high contrast image for rivers with Python and Rasterio , then polygonizes the image array and exports the river edges as a georeferenced Shapefile.

### Input data:

> The input data must be done by providing the .TIF file, in the Data folder.

### How to run:

> Install all the libraries in the requirements file.
> Run the riverDetection_v1.py

	pip run riverDetection_v1
